      <h2>HTML</h2>
      <p>
        HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and other web-based documents. Here are some short notes on HTML:

        HTML uses a series of tags to define the structure and content of a web page.
        Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< >) and can contain attributes that provide additional information about the content.
        HTML documents typically include a head section (containing metadata and script references) and a body section (containing the visible content).
        HTML supports a wide range of content types, including text, images, audio, video, and interactive elements like forms and buttons.
        HTML5, the current version of HTML, introduced many new features, such as semantic tags for structuring content and multimedia support without requiring plugins.
        HTML is often used in conjunction with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript to create visually appealing and interactive web pages.
        Overall, HTML is an essential language for creating web pages and is widely used across the web development industry.

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation and styling of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and other markup languages. Here are some short notes on CSS:

        CSS is used to define the visual layout and appearance of web pages, including the colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning of elements.
        CSS uses a series of rules, each consisting of a selector and a declaration block, to apply styles to specific elements or groups of elements.
        Selectors can be based on HTML element types, classes, IDs, or other attributes, and can be combined to create more specific rules.
        Declaration blocks contain one or more property-value pairs, where the property specifies the aspect of the element being styled (e.g. "color" for text color) and the value specifies the desired styling for that property (e.g. "red").
        CSS also supports various units of measurement, such as pixels, percentages, and ems, for specifying dimensions and spacing.
        CSS3, the current version of CSS, introduced many new features, such as transitions, animations, and media queries for responsive design.
        CSS is often used in conjunction with HTML and JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive web pages.
        Overall, CSS is a crucial language for creating visually appealing and responsive web pages, and is widely used across the web development industry.

    <div class="JavaScript">
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      <p>
        JavaScript is a programming language used primarily for creating interactive and dynamic web pages. Here are some short notes on JavaScript:

        JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted language, meaning that it can be run on any device with a compatible browser without the need for a separate compiler or runtime environment.
        JavaScript is used to create dynamic and interactive web pages by manipulating the HTML and CSS in real-time, responding to user input, and making requests to servers for data.
        JavaScript syntax is similar to that of C and C++, but with a more relaxed and forgiving structure that makes it easier to learn for beginners.
        JavaScript is often used in conjunction with HTML and CSS to create complete web applications, but it can also be used in other environments such as servers and desktop applications.
        JavaScript has a vast library of third-party frameworks and plugins that can be used to extend its functionality, such as React, Angular, and jQuery.
        JavaScript is also used for server-side programming, with popular frameworks like Node.js allowing for the creation of server-side applications using JavaScript.
        Overall, JavaScript is a versatile and powerful language that is widely used for creating interactive web pages and complete web applications.
